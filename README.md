# Electricity Consumption Analysis and Prediction

Accurate electricity demand forecasting is crucial for effective energy planning. This project predicts electricity consumption for the Baneshwor area using data from the local Grid Office. We applied KNN, Linear Regression, and XGBoost algorithms, with XGBoost showing the best performance (MSE: 0.03, RMSE: 0.18, RÂ²: 0.95).
